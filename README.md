# Advanced-Web-Applications-Project Documentation
This is the project work of the Advanced Web Applications course.

## Technology used
Here is described all the important technologies used in the project, what they are for, and why they were chosen for this app.
### Backend
For the backend I used Node.js combined with Express framework. I used express-generator command-line tool to create the express server skeleton without any views. No views were needed because I build the frontend as a separated project with react. All the server-side code is written in JavaScript. 

**Used npm packages:**

### Frontend
For the frontend I used react framework combined with mainly my own components and Material UI components.  Material UI is a good framework for react because the documentation is good and there is a lot of good components making the building of UI easier. The frontend skeleton was generated with the create-react-app command-line tool.

**Used npm packages:**
